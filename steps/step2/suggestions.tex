\subsection{Suggestions}
Having reached the end of the bottom-up analysis we would like to mention some suggestions that we believe would improve the structural organisation of OptaPlanner and provide an easier transition into the understanding of the source code. Some suggestions are also intended as a heads-up for the development team.\\\\
Various classes are using deprecated methods. They have been annotated with the \verb!@Deprecated! annotation, but they are still being used. It could be the case that in upcoming deployments of the system they will be updated or replaced, however, for the time being they remain in the source code.\\\\
The only way for developers to define their problems for the OptaPlanner are by preparing \verb!xml! files. However, this notation is no longer as popular in the software environment nowadays. Perhaps it would be more beneficial to the users of OptaPlanner if other formats were also used for defining a problem such as \verb!.json!. However, this would require a lot of rework especially in the Configuration system.\\\\
We would also recommend that the development team tries to minimize the dependency of the API on the Implementation system as much as possible, because it could interfere with the backwards compatibilty of the system, especially since the Implementation system is not backwards compatible and it is already working with deprecated methods.
